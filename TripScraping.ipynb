      "  review_body : Went there for a family breakfast as normally nothing opens 7am in Paris.Been there till 7:45 and they still wouldnt let us in.Their hours of work are from 7am.Finnally we got inside at around 8! Very very poor staff and food! Ordered what we wanted at the pay machine and been waiting for our order around 20 mins and we still didnt get nothing! I want to mention that this ‘mcdonalds’ was not busy at all as we were one of the first to come in and order.After a long time my wife went to someone to ask if we will get any food,the lady looked very angry,took our receipt and in under 20 sec a 25 euro order was done! I will attach a picture so that u can see how fresh was our food!Very innacurate order,rude staff and finnaly this is not a Mcdonalds! Its a chinese copy! Avoid! \n",

After that it was a wait to find an open table only to discover our fries we cold and had no salt.

Went to use the toilets and I can honestly say they are the most disgusting toilets I have ever been confronted with- floors covered in water and urine, faeces on toilet tissue on the floor, bins overflowing, etc. I was dry reaching and needless to say had to leave the area without using the facilities. For an international franchise that prides itself on setting consistent standards you need to review this store McDonalds as it is an absolute disgrace!\n",

It was quite busy but the staff also spoke English. You have to go to the cafe section for the coffee and muffin and normal food is served at the back of the first floor. A good stop for a break and toilet. \n",

However, beware that there are two branches of McDonald's on the Champs Elysées. This one at number 140 is on the ground and first floor, the latter boasting a huge window over the boulevard. Dining spaces are very wide and there are no queues for the toilets. The branch at number 84 scores much, much worse on all the above points.\n",

I'm not sure if it was just added security for the Euro 2016, so I don't know if they are always there. We wanted to eat here because we had a 6 and a 9 year old who love McDonald's and thought it would be cool to eat on Champs Elysees without spending a ton of money. It seems like all of the McDonald's here have the order kiosks, so you can feel comfortable ordering your food if you don't know the language. I noticed many of the employees speak English, though, so it would probably be just as easy to order at the counter. The McCafe was very nice. They have many pastries including muffins, macaroons, cakes, etc. They even put the macaroons in a cute little box. They are half the price you would pay if you bought them in most other cafes. They weren't the best tasting macaroons we had while here, but I would definitely recommend you try them. I did enjoy the peanut butter and chocolate muffin and I would highly recommend it.\n",
